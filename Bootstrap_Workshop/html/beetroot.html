                    <p id="info">Beetroot (Beta vulgaris) is a root vegetable also known as red beet, table beet, garden
                        beet, or just beet. Packed with essential nutrients, beetroots are a great source of fiber,
                        folate (vitamin B9), manganese, potassium, iron, and vitamin C. Beetroots and beetroot juice
                        have been associated with numerous health benefits, including improved blood flow, lower blood
                        pressure, and increased exercise performance. Many of these benefits are due to their high
                        content of inorganic nitrates. Beetroots are delicious raw but more frequently cooked or
                        pickled. Their leaves — known as beet greens — can also be eaten. There are numerous types of
                        beetroot, many of which are distinguished by their color — yellow, white, pink, or dark purple.
                    </p>
                    <footer>Beetroots are usually well tolerated but contain oxalates — which may lead to kidney stones
                        — and FODMAPs, which may cause digestive issues.</footer>

                        phyto-chemical compounds firstly; help protect the human body from oxidant stress, diseases, and
                        cancers, and secondly; help the body develop the capacity to fight against these by boosting

                    vegetables per year for optimum health.</p>
