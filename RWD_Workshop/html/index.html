            <h1>What is Agile ?</h1>
            <p>Agile software development refers to a group of software development methodologies based on iterative
                development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing
                cross-functional teams. Agile methods or Agile processes generally promote a disciplined project
                management process that encourages frequent inspection and adaptation, a leadership philosophy that
                encourages teamwork, self-organization and accountability, a set of engineering best practices intended
                to allow for rapid delivery of high-quality software, and a business approach that aligns development
                with customer needs and company goals. Agile development refers to any development process that is
                aligned with the concepts of the Agile Manifesto. The Manifesto was developed by a group of fourteen
                leading figures in the software industry, and reflects their experience of what approaches do and do not
                work for software development.</p>
